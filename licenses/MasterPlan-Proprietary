Feel free to use the program itself and the generated plan files in the development of projects, commercial or otherwise, as that's the point of the tool, haha. You can also build MasterPlan yourself using the repo here, contribute to its development, and fork it freely, but you may not use any assets (graphics files, sound files, code, etc) from this repository in any commercial creations. Please also do not distribute builds of MasterPlan to others.
